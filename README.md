# Battleship

![alt hydro1](http://www.lukaszkedziora.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bs1.jpg)

Console version of one of the most popular games in the world called Battleship. The project is a result of my very first contact with objective-oriented programming. After starting the game, you can choose who you want to play with â€“ AI or a real person. The AI mode is based on a simple implementation of Monte Carlo method developed by J. Neumann and S. Ulam in 1949.
